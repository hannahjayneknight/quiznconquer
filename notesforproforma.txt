Peer review comment of de-capitalizing the word.

Documents the identification and resolution of subtle bugs i.e. edge and corner cases 
in a systematised way.
    --- EDGE CASE = problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) 
    operating parameter. 

        *** EG: what happens when a player fills the whole board? Check that H.freeTile() and
        surroundingTiles() functions both work.

    Initially, when the board was full, H.freeTile() returned undefined. How I resolved this.

    --- CORNER CASE = as above but when multiple variables are at their extremes. 

    EG: when both the x and y coordinates of a tile are at their extreme (ie an edge or 
    corner piece).

    Initially, when an element was parsed into surroundingTiles(), the following array was
    returned:

    [
        element + 5,
        element - 5,
        element + 7,
        element - 7,
        element + 6,
        element - 6,
        element + 1,
        element - 1,
    ]

    However, for the edge and corner tiles, this would return tiles that were on the other 
    side of the board. This meant that a player would not win a tile directly next to the 
    tiles they currently own. Instead,

initially, divNums was part of the global scope and the function getIndexOf K would take in
any matrix and any K and return the index. However, this is a problem if the matrix parsed
in has more than one K in it, in which case the function returns the first index where K is.
But this isn't necessarily correct and is unwanted in our code, so divNums was removed from
the global scope.
