Documents the identification and resolution of subtle bugs i.e. edge and corner cases 
in a systematised way.
    --- EDGE CASE = problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) 
    operating parameter. 

        *** EG: what happens when a player fills the whole board? Check that H.freeTile() and
        surroundingTiles() functions both work.

    Initially, when the board was full, H.freeTile() returned undefined. How I resolved this.

    --- CORNER CASE = as above but when multiple variables are at their extremes. 

    EG: when both the x and y coordinates of a tile are at their extreme (ie an edge or 
    corner piece).

    Initially, when an element was parsed into surroundingTiles(), the following array was
    returned:

    However, for the edge and corner tiles, this would return tiles that were on the other

    tiles they currently own. Instead,
