One game would look like this:

games.WXYZ = {

    players: {
        player1: { player web socket object goes here },
        player2: { player web socket object goes here },
        player3: { player web socket object goes here },
        player4: { player web socket object goes here }
    },
    public: true

}

whether it is private or public.
